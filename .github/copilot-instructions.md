# React

## Hooks

- The file name and function name should match, and the function name should start with the prefix use.
- Avoid default exports; instead, use named exports.
- Use useMemo or useCallback to memoize variables and functions when necessary.
- Return values should be in an object format with `<const>` for better type inference.
